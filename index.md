### Biography
I am currently pursuing my PhD in the Department of Computer Science at Emory University, under the advisory of [Dr. Liang Zhao](https://cs.emory.edu/~lzhao41/index.htm). Prior to this, I earned my Bachelor degree in Software Engineering from Tsinghua University in 2022. During my undergraduate studies, I had the opportunity to work at the Data Mining Group at School of Software, Tsinghua University, supervised by Dr. Chunping Li. 

My research interest mainly lies in Graph Learning, LLMs, and Generative AI.
