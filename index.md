### Biography
I am currently pursuing my PhD in the Department of Computer Science at Emory University, under the advisory of [Dr. Liang Zhao](https://cs.emory.edu/~lzhao41/index.htm). Prior to this, I earned my Bachelor of Engineering degree in Software Engineering from Tsinghua University in 2022. During my undergraduate studies, I had the opportunity to contribute as a Research Assistant to the Tsinghua (School of Software) Data Mining Group, supervised by Dr. Chunping Li. 

My research interest mainly lies in Graph Machine Learning and Explainable AI.
