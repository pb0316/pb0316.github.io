<p>I am presently pursuing my PhD in the Department of Computer Science at Emory University, under the advisory of <a href="https://cs.emory.edu/~lzhao41/index.htm">Dr. Liang Zhao</a>. Prior to this, I earned my Bachelor of Engineering degree in Software Engineering from Tsinghua University in 2022. During my undergraduate studies, I had the opportunity to contribute as a Research Assistant to the Tsinghua (School of Software) Data Mining Group, where I was supervised by Dr. Chunping Li. Before coming to Tsinghua University, I spent three lovely years at Tianjin Yaohua High School.</p>

<p>My research interest lies in <strong>deep generative models</strong> and <strong>graph neural networks</strong>.</p>
